# Shallow Neural Networks for Mushrooms
The project implements a simple neural network model to predict whether a particular mushroom that you see is edible or poisonous. The dataset used is Mushroom Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Execution
* Execute data_prep.py to create datasets for training, testing and validation of the neural network.
* Execute proj_test.py to run the neural network.
